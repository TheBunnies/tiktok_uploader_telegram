Send the link, wait for the response, forward the video to your friends!
No watermarks as well.

## Linux and Docker support

2. Build image and run the container `docker-compose up -d --build`


## Proxying 
You might want to use proxy for this bot to bypass Tiktok API restrictions. 
Since my own instance of the bot is running on a Russian server I can't get any details about foreign videos.

If you want proxying: specify your proxy credentials in .env file

If you do not want proxying: just leave credentials empty
